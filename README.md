# DATA ENGINEERING INTERN

## üìã Introduction

Data plays a pivotal role in driving insights and decision-making across various domains. In the transportation sector, analyzing train operation data can uncover valuable trends, enhance operational efficiency, and improve service delivery. This document outlines a comprehensive data engineering task designed to guide the exploration, transformation, and analysis of a train dataset.

## ‚öôÔ∏èSoftware Used

### Programming Language: Python

Why: The reason is that it has an excellent library support and good community support for data engineering.

Important Libraries:

Pandas: Loads, cleans, and manipulates the data.

Matplotlib/Seaborn/Plotly: Does the plots like bar charts, histograms, and heatmaps.

Jupyter Notebook: For exploration, documentation, and presentation.

### Data Handling and Storage:

Excel or CSV Files: To store and retrieve the dataset.

Databases (Optional):
SQLite/MySQL/PostgreSQL: To query and store cleaned data, if dataset size is huge or involves database interaction.

Why: CSV/Excel files are light-weight, whereas databases are scalable for huge datasets.

### Integrated Development Environment (IDE):

Jupyter Notebook: For iterative coding and inline visualization.

VS Code/PyCharm: For writing and debugging Python scripts.

Why: These tools facilitate smooth coding and support integration with version control.

Visualization Tools:

Matplotlib and Seaborn: For generating standard visualizations like line plots, bar charts, and histograms.
Plotly is used for interactive and interactive advanced visualizations.
These libraries provide flexibility and personalization in presenting insights.

## Level Task 

### üìå **Level 1: Data Exploration and Basic Operations**

**Tasks and Approach:**
1. **Load and Inspect Data:**
   - Load the dataset using Python (e.g., Pandas `pd.read_csv()` or similar depending on the file type).
   - Display the first 10 rows (`df.head(10)`).
   - Inspect data structure (`df.info()`), check for missing values (`df.isnull().sum()`), and understand column data types.

2. **Basic Statistics:**
   - Use Pandas for statistics like `df.describe()` to get a summary.
   - Calculate unique counts (`df['source_station'].nunique()`, etc.).
   - Identify the most common stations using `df['source_station'].value_counts()`.

3. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Handle missing values (e.g., imputation or removal).
   - Standardize station names by converting them to uppercase (`df['station_column'].str.upper()`).

**Skills Practiced:**
- Data loading and exploration.
- Working with missing data and standardizing formats.

**What You'll Learn:**
- Basic Pandas operations.
- Data cleaning techniques.


### üìå **Level 2: Data Transformation and Aggregation**

**Tasks and Approach:**
1. **Data Filtering:**
   - Use conditions to filter data (e.g., `df[df['day'] == 'Saturday']`).
   - Create new DataFrames for specific queries.

2. **Grouping and Aggregation:**
   - Group data using `df.groupby()` and calculate metrics like counts or averages.

3. **Data Enrichment:**
   - Add columns based on conditions (`np.where()` or `apply()`).
   - Categorize data into new groups like ‚ÄòWeekday‚Äô or ‚ÄòWeekend‚Äô.

**Skills Practiced:**
- Data filtering using logical conditions.
- Grouping and summarizing data.
- Feature engineering.

**What You'll Learn:**
- How to manipulate datasets to extract meaningful information.
- Aggregating data for insights.


### üìå **Level 3: Advanced Data Analysis**

**Tasks and Approach:**
1. **Pattern Analysis:**
   - Use visualization libraries (Matplotlib, Seaborn) to create bar plots or histograms.
   - Analyze train operations trends by visualizing counts per station or per day.

2. **Correlation and Insights:**
   - Calculate correlations (`df.corr()`) and analyze them.
   - Provide insights based on patterns identified (e.g., busiest stations or optimal days for train scheduling).

**Skills Practiced:**
- Data visualization.
- Statistical analysis.

**What You'll Learn:**
- Spotting trends and patterns in data.
- Applying statistical methods to real-world problems.


### üìå **Level 4: Data Visualization and Reporting**

**Tasks and Approach:**
1. **Visualization:**
   - Create advanced visualizations like heatmaps (Seaborn‚Äôs `heatmap`) or line charts (Matplotlib‚Äôs `plot`).
   - Visualize trends in data such as day-wise train counts or busiest stations.

2. **Reporting:**
   - Compile findings into a report using Jupyter Notebooks or presentation software.
   - Include all visualizations, explanations, and actionable insights.


### **How to Finish the Task**
1. **Start with Level 1:** Understand the dataset and its structure before diving deeper.
2. **Move Sequentially:** Each level builds upon the previous one, so complete them in order.
3. **Use Python Libraries:**
   - Pandas for data manipulation.
   - NumPy for calculations.
   - Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualization.
4. **Document Progress:** Keep notes of methods, challenges, and solutions for reporting.

### **Key Learning Outcomes**
- Mastery of data manipulation using Pandas.
- Cleaning and transforming datasets for insights.
- Visualizing data to communicate findings.
- Compiling professional reports with actionable recommendations.
